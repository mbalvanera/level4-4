<h4>I want to be your perfect scent, your missed rent,<br> those days you feel you need to repent.<br> 
I want you to listen to these cheesy rhymes,<br> feeding me these sweet lines, be together all the time.<br> 
    I want to be your dark brown hair, the place<br> back when we didn't care, the memories only we share.</h4>

<em>Was it someone like you who did it to be so kind
Leaves on the grass with words drawn out
You admired me and wanted to hold my hand
I let the curtains fly in
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by

Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans
Dropping love on my sleeve
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen
I never knew a heart could beat for me</em>
